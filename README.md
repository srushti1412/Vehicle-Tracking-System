# Vehicle-Tracking-System
This project is a vehicle tracking system with accident detection capabilities. 
It uses an MPU6050 accelerometer and gyroscope to detect falls or accidents, a SIM800L module to send SMS alerts, and a Neo-6M GPS module to provide location data. The system is designed to monitor the vehicle's motion and detect any abnormal activity indicative of an accident, then alert predefined contacts with the vehicle's location.
